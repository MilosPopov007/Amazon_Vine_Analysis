"Big Market" is a startup that helps businesses optimize their marketing efforts.<br> One of "Big Markets" clients has requested some pretty hefty analytics.<br> The client "Sell-By" is about to release a large catalog of products on a leading retail website.<br> They want to know how the reviews of their products compared to the reviews of similar products sold by their competitors. They're also interested in enrolling in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers, but they want to know if it's worth the cost.

<br> As a Data Analyst for "Big Market" I was hired to harness that power of Big Data.<br> There are thousands of reviews, and they're words, not numbers, so I will  "translate" them in order to analyze them.
